  - indicate when they have focus
  - change in appearance when touched (in the touch-down state)
  - be usable with touch
  - be usable with [voice commands](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspectives/voice.html)
  - have visible text
  - have a meaningful accessible name

  [Keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#radiobutton)

  - when a radio group receives focus:
    - if a radio button is checked, focus is set on the checked button.
    - if none of the radio buttons are checked, focus is set on the first radio button in the group.
  - Space: checks the focused radio button if it is not already checked.
  - Right Arrow and Down Arrow: move focus to the next radio button in the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button. If focus is on the last button, focus moves to the first button.
  - Left Arrow and Up Arrow: move focus to the previous radio button in the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button. If focus is on the first button, focus moves to the last button.

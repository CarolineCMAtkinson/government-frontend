name: Contents list
description: Lists a pageâ€™s contents with links pointing to headings within the document
body: |
  Pass a list of contents each with an `href` and `text`. The `href` should point at the ID of a heading within the page.

  Supports nesting contents one level deep, currently only used by specialist documents. When nesting the top level list items
  display in bold.

  `format_numbers` option will pull out numbers in the link text to render them as though they were the list style type. Applies to
  numbers at the start of text, with or without a decimal. See the [format complex numbers fixture](/component-guide/contents-list/formats_complex_numbers) for details.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must be [a landmark with a navigation role](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/27/using-navigation-landmarks/).

  The contents list must:

  - inform the user how many items are in the list
  - convey the content structure

  The contents item links must:

  - accept focus
  - be focusable with a keyboard
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - indicate when it has focus
  - change in appearance when touched (in the touch-down state)
  - change in appearance when hovered
  - be usable with touch
  - be usable with [voice commands](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspectives/voice.html)
  - have visible text

  Links with formatted numbers must separate the number and text with a space for correct screen reader pronunciation. This changes pronunciation from "1 dot Item" to "1 Item".
